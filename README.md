This repo contains an updated and modified version of a coursework project to make a C-89 to MIPs 1 compiler. The specification for this can be found at https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2017-cw . This coursework was finished over the course of eight weeks, and was coded by myself and my partner, Kyzarok.
